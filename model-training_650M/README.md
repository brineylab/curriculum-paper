### Training 650M-param models

* Training code for 650M parameters models, including CurrAb. 
* These models were trained using the **full** dataset, which can be downloaded from Zenodo. 
* Training scripts were run using Deepspeed through the Accelerate library, as described [here](https://github.com/brineylab/deepspeed).
