### Model Eval

Code for model evaluation, including inference and specificity classification tasks. Pair classification code can be found [here](https://github.com/brineylab/preferential-masking-paper). Classification scripts were run using Deepspeed through the Accelerate library, as described [here](https://github.com/brineylab/deepspeed).
