### Training 55M-param Models

* Training code for 55M parameters models, in Figures 2-4.
* These models were trained using the **downsampled** dataset, which can be downloaded from Zenodo. 
* Training scripts were run using Deepspeed through the Accelerate library, as described [here](https://github.com/brineylab/deepspeed).
